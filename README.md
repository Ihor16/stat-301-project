### Data:

- [Dataset article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35249-3_76) (need to access via UBC Library)

### Evaluation:
- Studying is different for each class (Note-taking)
- Data set is not grouped by `COURSE ID`
- Students may have cheated and therefore the final grades are not representative
